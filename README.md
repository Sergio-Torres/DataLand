# DataLand
Create graphics in your browser using Django and Bokeh
DataLand is an application that allows the creation of graphics in the browser, inserted through a table, requires 
registration and login to access this function, for now only working with 5 coordinates formed by the x and y axes. 
In the future (since it is still in development) it is expected to be able to create graphs with various coordinates, 
equations and loaded files (such as .csv, for example). 

I don't have an npm install or a npm run build yet, because at the moment I don't know how to implement them.

With this clarified, if you want to use the application you should take into account that it uses technologies such as:

* Django - Python
* Bokeh - Python (to create the graphics in the browser)
* Psycopg2
* PostgreSQL
