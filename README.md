# DataLand
Create graphics in your browser using Django and Bokeh
DataLand is an application that allows the creation of graphics in the browser, inserted through a table, requires 
registration and login to access this function, for now only working with 5 coordinates formed by the x and y axes. 
In the future (since it is still in development) it is expected to be able to create graphs with various coordinates, 
equations and loaded files (such as .csv, for example). 

If you want to use the application you should take into account that it uses technologies such as:

* Django - Python
* Bokeh - Python (to create the graphics in the browser)
* Psycopg2
* PostgreSQL
